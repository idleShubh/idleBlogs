                <h2>So its been 2 months since I moved to Bengaluru…</h2>

                <p>What a ride it’s been! Moving from Lucknow to this fast-paced city for my studies has been nothing short of an emotional roller-coaster. New traditions, a different language, and so many new faces — it’s been a major shift from the comfort of home. Leaving my parents and friends behind wasn’t easy, and there were plenty of moments when I found myself thinking about the good old days with a sense of nostalgia.
                    <br><br>
                    It took me a solid month to adjust ( survive ), bcz
                    <br><br>
                    1. Almost got scammed twice (rookie mistake) <br>
                    2. Cabs are ridiculously expensive <br>
                    3. Hard water struggles (RO water hair wash, anyone?) <br>
                    4. Food’s pricey and, well, not great <br>
                    5. The public transport system is a maze <br>
                    6. Traffic? Oh, it’s a feature, not a bug.
                    <br><br>
                    But now that I’m comfortable, I’ve made some incredible friends, already created a ton of memories, and yes, survived my mid-terms!
                    Oh, and did I mention I’ve had the privilege to meet some of the most influential people in the country? Including:
                    <br><br>
                    - Amod Malviya (co-founder of udaan.com) <br>
                    - Akash Saxena (CTO of JioCinema) <br>
                    - Varun Mohan (CEO of Codeium) <br>
                    - Ankit Goyal ( Vice President Paytm ) <br>
                    - Pulkit Jain ( Co-Founder of Vedantu ) and many more….
                    <br><br>
                    This is just the beginning. I’m embracing the change, settling into Bangalore life, and pushing myself to make the most out of my journey with Scaler School of Technology.</p>
