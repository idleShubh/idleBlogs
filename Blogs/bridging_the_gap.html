                <p>Life is Full of changes and one of the big ones is moving from school to college. But there’s a tricky time in between when things get a bit confusing. After school ends and while waiting for college news, this mix of feelings can be pretty overwhelming. It’s like life hits pause, and you’re stuck wondering what’s next. 
                    <br> <br>
                    You just finished school, a big achievement, yet suddenly you’re waiting, and waiting… The excitement of the next step is mixed with nervousness. The future seems exciting but also a little scary because you don’t know where you’ll end up.
                    <br> <br>
                    Social media makes it harder for you. You see friends talking about their college acceptance, and it’s great for them, but it can make you worry more about whether you’ll make it too. Suddenly, you’re not so sure about yourself. You ask, “Dis I do enough?” “Am I good enough?”
                    <br> <br>
                    You start flipping through college brochures, imaging different paths, but there’s a fear that holds you back. What, if you don’t get accepted? What if your dreams don’t come true?
                    <br> <br>
                    In this uncertainty, there’s a chance for growth. It might feel like things are on hold, but this time can be about discovering new things about yourself. Trying out hobbies, spending time with your family, exploring subjects that interest you — it all helps you grow.
                    <br> <br>
                    Remember, it’s okay to feel unsure. It’s like a pit stop before a big race. You’re getting ready for something amazing, even if the path isn’t clear right now. Life is like that — a mix of uncertain steps that lead to exciting destinations.</p>
