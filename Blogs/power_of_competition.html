                <h2>The Power of Competition How Two Food Vendors Made Our Mess Better</h2>
                <label for="date">Date: 11 Oct 2024</label>
                <br> <hr> <br>
                <p>Competition is often seen as the driving force behind innovation, improvement, and customer satisfaction. Our experience at the Scaler School of Technology (SST) hostel is a testament to how a little rivalry can lead to significant improvements, especially regarding something as essential as food.
                    <br><br>
                    At our hostel, we used to have just one food vendor, and honestly, his food was pretty bad. Most of us didn’t enjoy the meals, but since there was no other option, we had to put up with it. The vendor didn’t really improve because he didn’t have any competition, and we were stuck with what we got.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, we, as a student body, decided to take matters into our own hands by forming a food committee (special shoutout to Sarthak Arora). Our goal was clear: bring in a new vendor to create competition and force a change. We couldn’t remove the old vendor completely since he was hired by the hostel (which also houses working professionals), but we thought having a new one alongside him might change things.
                    <br><br>
                    The results were nothing short of remarkable. The new vendor quickly gained popularity, with over 80% of students preferring his food. The change was refreshing — students were excited to finally have meals that tasted good. But the most surprising outcome wasn’t just the success of the new vendor; it was the response of the old one.
                    <br><br>
                    Faced with the loss of customers, the original vendor didn’t give up. Instead, he began collecting feedback, improving the quality of his meals, and even introducing new dishes to win back his audience. Day by day, his food became more appealing, proving that competition had brought out the best in him.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, the new vendor isn’t just chilling either. He knows he has to keep his customers happy, so he’s working hard to maintain the quality that won everyone over in the first place. So now, we’ve got a full-on food battle going on, with both vendors stepping up their game to win.
                    <br><br>
                    The best part? We, the students, are living the dream. Some of our friends have gone back to the old vendor because, hey, he’s actually serving decent food now. Others are sticking with the new guy. In the middle of all this, we get the best of both worlds.
                    <br><br>
                    This situation illustrates a broader truth about markets and consumer welfare. When companies or service providers operate without competition, complacency can set in, and customers are left with subpar offerings. But when competition enters the picture, the customer becomes the true winner, as each competitor strives to provide better products or services. A monopoly, on the other hand, often stifles growth and innovation, leaving customers with no choice but to accept whatever is offered.
                    <br><br>
                    In our mess, the emergence of competition transformed what was once a miserable dining experience into a dynamic, evolving space where both vendors continuously strive to improve. This demonstrates that competition benefits customers and motivates businesses to perform at their best.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, the lesson is clear: no company or vendor should have a monopoly. Whether in the tech industry or a hostel mess, competition keeps the playing field fair and pushes everyone involved to reach their highest potential. The power of competition, as we’ve experienced, truly works in favor of the customer.
